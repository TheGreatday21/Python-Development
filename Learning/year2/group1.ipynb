    "- An outlier is a data point that is abnormally higher or lower than the rest of the data in a given data set \n",

    "##### Importance of outliers \n",
    "- They help us spot errors in data entry and measurement.\n",
    "- Outliers can help us determine unexpected phenomenon in our data \n",
    "- Ignoring outliers completely from our data can sometimes lead to skewed results in our data analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Sources of outliers \n",
    "1. Poor data entry into a dataset.\n",
    "2. Faulty measurements from equipment.\n",

    "\n",
    "##### Types of outliers \n",
    "1. <strong>Global outliers(Point anomalies)</strong>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    These are outliers where one data point is extremly skewed compared to the rest of the data points in the data set forexample in sample data of average wage for people in a company being 500,000 UGX but one individual is earning 130,000,000 UGX</p>\n",
    "2. <strong>Contexual outliers (Conditional anomalies)</strong>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    As the name states thihs are outliers that appear when usually in one condition but are abnormal in another forexample a temperature of 25 degrees celcius is normal for data colleected in summer but abnormal if it is seen in winter time  \n",
    "    </p>\n",
    "3. <strong>Collective outliers (Group anomalies)</strong>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "    These are outliers where a group of datapoints all behave unusually even if the individual datapoints seem normal forexample if you are monitoring network traffic and a sudden burst occurs on the network, it may indicate a cyber attack\n",
