    "\n",
    "- Stratified sampling - data split into strata. Prior knowledge is required about the data. Its limitations is oversampling one strata more than the other strata causing unbalanced data .You have to actually split the data into groups and carryout simple random sampling on each group </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simple random sampling - data is randomly chosen . The probability of all events is the same cause choosing is random. Its limit is not having a list because you do not know who you are going to sample</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster sampling - Sampling used for large geographical areas. Its limitations is that it is location bound. In cluster we randomly pick areas and take all the people in the cluster .</br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Systematic sampling - Selecting samples from data at predetermined intervals . Can be biased if there is no specific order to the data. It can be done with ot without a list . Its limitations is that you cannot use it if the data is already in pattern  </br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- Convenience sampling - Sampling from a population based on its availability . Its can be done under low risk conditions like asking guys about a product in a mall. This is the cheapest type of sampling . It s limitations is that the results can be very biased since your only asking a small group of people \n",
