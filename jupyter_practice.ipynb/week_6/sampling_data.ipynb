    "- Stratified sampling - data split into strata. Prior knowledge is required about the data.\n",
    "- Simple random sampling - data is randomly chosen . The probability of all events is the same cause choosing is random \n",
    "- Cluster sampling - Data is divided into smaller known groups.\n",
    "- Systematic sampling - Selecting samples from data at predetermined intervals . Can be biased if there is no specific order to the data \n",
    "- Convenience sampling - Sampling from a population based on its availability . Like asking guys about a product in a mall. This is the cheapest type of sampling .\n",
