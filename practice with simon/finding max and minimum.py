## Find the max and the min

numbers = (1,2,3,2,4,6,7)
print(f"Max {max(numbers)} , Min {min(numbers)}")
##These are what we refer to as tuples in python


##Swapping values
(a,b) = (5,20)
print(f"a = {a} and b = {b}")
(a,b) = (b,a)#here is were we interchage/swap them positions init
print(f"After swapping a = {a} and b = {b}")
